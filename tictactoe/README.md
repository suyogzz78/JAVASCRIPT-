🎮 Tic Tac Toe – A Classic Game Reimagined
Welcome to my take on the game of Tic Tac Toe! Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is a fun way to sharpen your frontend skills—or just settle a friendly rivalry.

🧰 Tech Stack
This game is built using:
- 🧾 HTML5 – For the structure
- 🎨 CSS3 – For layout and styling (Flexbox magic!)
- ⚙️ JavaScript – For game logic and interactivity

🕹️ How to Play
- Open the game in your browser.
- Player 1 starts with O, Player 2 follows with X.
- Click on any empty box to make your move.
- The game checks for a winner after every turn.
- If someone wins, a message pops up. You can then:
- Hit Reset to clear the board
- Or click New Game to start over
